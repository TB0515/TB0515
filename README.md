## 💼 Strategic HR | 👩‍💻 Developer | 🎲 Game creator | 📈 Data enthusiast

Curiosity brought me from people analytics to programming!  
Now, I code web apps, mini-games, and experiment with anything JavaScript, Node.js, or APIs.  
Currently learning at Founders and Coders bootcamp and always up for a challenge, a chat, or collaboration.
